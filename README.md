# Code2Career-Training---Mobile-Development-Assignment-2

Question 1 : Write a Dart program that:
Reads two numbers (assign directly for simplicity).Checks if either is odd and the other is even, or both are positive (using &&, ||).Uses ++ and -- to increment the first and decrement the second.Casts one result to an integer (toInt()).Applies the bitwise NOT ~ to the first number after casting.Prints true if the incremented first number is greater than the decremented second, using a conditional operator.

Question 2 : Write a Dart function that:
Takes a double number (e.g., num = 12.7).Prints the ceiling, floor, and rounded values.Concatenates the number as a string with a given name (e.g., "Value: 12.7").Uses ? : to print "Large" if the number is above 10, otherwise "Small".

Question 3 : Write Dart code that:
Declares a constant list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].Converts the list to a set and adds the value 12.Creates a map where keys are from the set and values are the numbers multiplied by 3.Prints the map.

Question 4 : Write a Dart program that:
Reads a number of days.Converts days to years (1 year = 365 days), months (1 month = 30 days) and reset days.Prints all results.
